# Enterprise Commit and Release Standard — HANTER-Public

**Repository:** oromaskevic23-cmd/HANTER-Public  
**Classification:** PUBLIC architecture and evidence  
**Protocol:** IMPERIAL Core Enterprise Evidence v1.0 — 2026-10-24
**State:** Policy document only; no Enterprise readiness certificate or production verification.

## Seven mandatory commit gates

1. **Scope:** descriptive Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, test:, docs:, refactor:, security:) with concise impact summary and breaking-change notes.
2. **Source provenance:** preserve historical authorship, licenses, upstream attribution, third-party models and human/LLM contributions; do not claim authorship of code not developed by the project.
3. **Verification:** record actually executed tests and relevant CI run URLs or explicitly mark NOT RUN / BLOCKED; never fabricate passing evidence.
4. **Security:** guard secrets, wallet credentials, private policies, dependencies and tool privileges; require approval for production, payments, domain crossings and security-sensitive tasks.
5. **Architecture:** preserve HANTER command coordination, VELEON canonical name, federated orchestration without a single global executor, and Universal NCA identity ≠ authority.
6. **Release gate:** E0 design, E1 spec, E2 code, E3 unit/static tests, E4 integration, E5 verified runtime, E6 verified production. Claims cannot exceed recorded evidence.
7. **Integrity:** retain historical commits. No force push or rewriting attribution; changes should be traceable, scoped, independently reviewable and reversible.

## Required change checklist

- [ ] Rationale, affected files, owners and impact documented
- [ ] Third-party licenses and contributor provenance preserved
- [ ] Actual test commands, PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED and environment recorded
- [ ] Secret/public-private and legal boundaries reviewed
- [ ] Requested privileges authorized; no agent self-escalation
- [ ] Docs, contracts and rollback updated when appropriate
- [ ] Release maturity label matches direct evidence

**Human team model:** IMPERIAL Core architectural initiative is founder-led by Alexander Romaskevich (RomaskevicH), supported by LLM tools. Do not invent human employees or issued shares. Where a component has different legal owners, verify and preserve those rights. The agent-scale objective of 1–1,000,000,000 Universal NCA identities is E0 future architecture, not deployed capacity.
